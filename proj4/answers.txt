- Does your program run the same way each time? Why?
It does not run the same way each time. Each time it is run, the threads enter into the semaphores in a different order. This is because there is so much else going on on the machine, that there is no gaurantee which thread will enter first. 

- Give you rlast customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?
I used the pthread_setschedparam() method to set the last thread (the 9th) to have the highest priority in one of my test runs in order to answer this. There was not much of a difference. The 9th thread was sometimes slightly bumped up in the order of running, but never showed any signs of being gauranteed to go first (in fact, I think that I never saw it go first).
